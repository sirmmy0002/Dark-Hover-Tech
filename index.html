            <p>Coding is the process of creating instructions that computers then interpret and follow. Coding is also
                known as programming - even though a lot of people would argue there is a slight difference between the
                two, coding and programming still reference the same general process in the long run.</p>

            <p>A hacker is an individual who uses computer, networking or other skills to overcome a technical problem.
                The term also may refer to anyone who uses their abilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or
                networks in order to commit crimes. A hacker may, for example, steal information to hurt people via
                identity theft.</p>
